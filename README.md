# Design-of-RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Processor-using-Verilog-
This Repository is a step wise design of RISC-V Single cycle processor .

The Design of RISCV_SINGLE_CYCLE Processor is divided into 4 stages. 

See the file Phases_RISCV_Single-Cycle_Processor.pdf to learn more about each phases {or each steps in design}.
[Phases_RISC-V_SINGLE_CYCLE_PROCESSOR.pdf](https://github.com/Tanishqgithub/Design-of-RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Processor-using-Verilog-/files/13783577/Phases_RISC-V_SINGLE_CYCLE_PROCESSOR.pdf)


For more detailed study of each components in each phase refer TB --> Computer organization and design- RISC-V edition by David A patterson {Chapter = The Processor}
{Prerequist knowledge of RISC-V Processor Design is required to undertand this repository}


The below riscv_report.pdf contains all the necessary codes and the required explanation for each phase and at last for whole RISCV-Module .
The report also Contains Simualtion Results and explanation , Code Coverage Report, Synthesis Report {power,area and timing reports} and Physical Design for final riscv module.

Note the Tools Used :
Simulation and Code Coverage: Cadence Incisive Simulator
Synthesis : Cadence Genus
Physical Design : Cadence Innovus 


Also Use the below slides riscv_slides.pdf created for above report for presentation .

Note that there are many repositories for riscv_single_cycle but this repository contains detail step by step {phases} and each component design in that phase for RISC-V Datapath and the Control Signal generation for RISC-V Control Unit
